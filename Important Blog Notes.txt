Making the weight be based on Y value
	Lerp between the 2 cloeset y Value using decimal left over
	Replace all the weights with the get weight calc
	Issue adding the weights to prefabs
		just never actaully made the array before assigning them
	was pretty easy and worked well
	like layering grids on top each other
Making the weight be effected by biome
	biome governed by temreture value 
		tempreture uses sign wave of the x pos
	distance from ideal temp affect the weighting
	encountered issue where having 0 weighted tiles prevented generation
	The trnastion tile had to much chance of spawning
	making keyframe to define what the the spawning should look like
	Added some snow tiles
	Then I broke everything
	fixed issue with tile rotation
	tiles worked without keyframe thing
	Manully added the off side sockets to grass for testing
	fixing issue with title unassigning own weights
	Made new example]
	weights could go above the array for y weightings
	Manully added the off side sockets to grass for testing is presenting an issue
	did fix isssue with unassigning own weights, was iterating incorrectly over the new prefabs beacuse of the new prototypes
	Still had to manually as some sockets to grass but it is now working
Propergation
	Added all items into a stack
	forgot to make 0 count as inside the grid
	now runs far faster
Treadmilliing
	But first some cleaning
	then dropping some tiles off the back
	Shifting adropping works just as video shows
	issue with end tiles not nulling
	Made basic tread mill that eventually breaks
	Now having to make the x sides not matter
	Very simple version mostly works, moving on to "planning" system
	New system works by pushing back the tiles being planned utill all the planned tiles are used up, then making them the planned tiles
	Treadmills untill desrt then breaks, time to look into when the weights change
	Need to clear possiblity space, attcully give it all possibilites
	this makes it work but lags hard every time it moves back
	A slight optimsiation to make the stack not duplicate items
	now working quite well, somtimes half fails but then success as the project ontinues
	Seems like it would be more efficent to generate whole thing in a loading screen then move onto the next level (see unrailed for example)
	Fixed the main issues I was having but now it lags when moving forwards
	Messed around with lighting for fog effect
	also made tiles drop a little less agrssivly
	numerus bug fixes
	now not enough tiles are planned
	somtimes chrashes in unity
