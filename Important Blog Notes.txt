Making the weight be based on Y value
	Lerp between the 2 cloeset y Value using decimal left over
	Replace all the weights with the get weight calc
	Issue adding the weights to prefabs
		just never actaully made the array before assigning them
	was pretty easy and worked well
	like layering grids on top each other
Making the weight be effected by biome
	biome governed by temreture value 
		tempreture uses sign wave of the x pos
	distance from ideal temp affect the weighting
	encountered issue where having 0 weighted tiles prevented generation
	The trnastion tile had to much chance of spawning
	making keyframe to define what the the spawning should look like
	Added some snow tiles
	Then I broke everything
	fixed issue with tile rotation
	tiles worked without keyframe thing
	Manully added the off side sockets to grass for testing
	fixing issue with title unassigning own weights
	Made new example]
	weights could go above the array for y weightings
	Manully added the off side sockets to grass for testing is presenting an issue
	did fix isssue with unassigning own weights, was iterating incorrectly over the new prefabs beacuse of the new prototypes
	Still had to manually as some sockets to grass but it is now working
